To use Selenium RC from Python:

* Download a Selenium RC zip file. To find one, go to http://seleniumhq.org/download/
  and click on the "Download" link labeled "Selenium RC".
  One such ZIP file is http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0-beta-2/selenium-remote-control-1.0-beta-2-dist.zip
* Unzip it
* Run it: e.g.
  $ java -jar selenium-remote-control-1.0-beta-2/selenium-server-1.0-beta-2/selenium-server.jar 

Now, with Selenium RC running, you can execute the Python sample code. For example:

$ python test_google.py

Now that you have that working, take a look at my (hackish) downloader
for PDFs from USPTO Public Pair.

Ta-da!
